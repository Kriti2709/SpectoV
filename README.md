🧠 Unsupervised Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction for AR/VR (KMeans, DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE)
This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning techniques like **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, **PCA**, and **t-SNE** can be applied to synthetic datasets, images, and real-world sensor data to simulate object recognition and segmentation workflows essential for **AR/VR systems**.
📋 Project Tasks
✅ Task 1: Understand Clustering Algorithms (K-Means and DBSCAN)
* Learn and implement basic clustering on 2D synthetic datasets.
* Visualize how **KMeans** and **DBSCAN** group data differently.
* Compare globular vs. arbitrary shape clustering.

* Google Colab Template for Clustering

✅ Task 2: Image Segmentation with K-Means
* Apply **unsupervised clustering (KMeans)** for basic image segmentation based on pixel color similarity.
* Reshape image pixels into 2D arrays and group similar colors.
* Experiment with changing `k` values to observe segmentation detail levels.
